## Setting up your Codespace

1. Download and install {{< link "https://code.visualstudio.com/" >}} Visual Studio Code {{< /link >}} if you haven't already

2. Visit the {{< link "https://github.com/cedadev/ceda-div-hugo-hinode" >}} Github page for the ceda site {{< /link >}} (note: this also works for any public directory)
    Make sure you're logged into Github

3. - Click on the 'Code' button
   - then click the Codespaces tab
   - then click on + to make a new Codespace from the repository
   {{< alert color="info" >}}
   Note: It will take a while to generate the new Codespace. Once it has been made you may get an error message, don't worry! This is a common occurence.
  
  {{< /alert >}}

   You should be able to see your new Codespace by clicking {{< link "https://github.com/codespaces" >}} here to go to your Codespaces homepage {{< /link >}}
