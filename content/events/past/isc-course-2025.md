The Introduction to Scientific Computing (ISC) course covers the skills needed to start using the Linux Shell and Python in environmental science research. The course is designed for complete beginners as well as those with a little experience who wish to further their knowledge. Some prerequisite Python knowledge is necessary to study the “Python Programming – Working with Data” module. On the final day of the “Working with Data” module there will be two parallel sessions focussing, respectively, on the use of atmospheric science data and earth observation data. Students may join either session depending on their own learning needs and preferences.

The course is taught as a series of hands-on workshops. Students may register for the whole course as a package, or individual modules to suit their own learning needs.

We aim to equip students with fundamental knowledge and build the skills that are essential for almost all researchers in modern scientific disciplines. Each topic will be introduced and students will then apply their learning by working through practical exercises, supported by the trainers. The course is highly interactive – students are encouraged to ask questions and request support as needed.

The course will also provide you with the necessary experience to attend our {{<link "https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/data-analysis-tools/">}}  Data Analysis Tools course {{</link>}} and  {{<link "https://ncas.ac.uk/study-with-us/atmospheric-measurement-summer-school/" >}} Atmospheric Measurement and Modelling Summer School. {{</link>}}
