Dear JASMIN and CEDA users,

At approximately 10:02 on 18th November 2025, during the migration of data in the CEDA archive, a mistake was made which resulted in some data being deleted from the archive. The issue was identified at approximately 12:07, the archive was  locked down preventing further loss by approximately 12:25, and the incident was fully diagnosed by 14:00.

As a result of this incident, approximately 5 Petabytes of data have been deleted from the archive.

With the exception of a the MODIS data, all lost data has been backed up to tape.

**NO Group Workspaces or user data has been lost.**

We are beginning the process of prioritising data for recovery from backup. We will be looking for feedback on priorities from users and data providers as we progress.

A recovery plan is presently being constructed. This will be shared in due course along with progress updates via a dedicated recovery status page. We expect full recovery from tape to be a slow process taking months.

Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience this will cause.
