Dear JASMIN and CEDA users,
we have an update on the CEDA Archive incident that occured on Tuesday the 18th of November. Some common questions are answered below including how to request which data you'd like to be a priority for recovery.

**What data is impacted?**
Approximately 5 petabytes of data has been impacted. We are collating a list of missing data. We will share this as soon as possible.

**How can I find the latest updates?**
Short summaries can be found {{< link "/status" >}} **here on our status page.** {{< /link >}} Longer descriptions can be found on specific news items (all listed here - https://www.ceda.ac.uk/tags/data-incident-nov25/)

**How can I request data to be recovered as a priority?**
Recovery prioritisation and sequencing will be based on a combination of factors including indicators of use, resourcing, recovery options, timescales and community input.

If you have contacted us about missing datasets which are a priority for you/your organisation, please email support@ceda.ac.uk with further details including:

- Your name
- Data requested
- Why is this a priority for you/your organisation?
- Any specific requirements (e.g. latest data first and work backwards/specific years within a dataset)

**Can I help by re-sending missing data?**
Thank you for the offer. You may be able to help, but not immediately.

All of the data can be recovered from our tape back-ups (or alternative methods). Other mechanisms (such as data being resent from source) may be a faster alternative to retrieval from tape.

If you think you may be able to help, please let us know some details. We will keep track of this information and will contact you if we need your assistance.

**How did this happen?**
Human error during a complex data migration. We operate a no blame culture within our team - please remember to be kind to our staff when communicating about this incident. Accidents happen.

We will be reviewing processes, sharing lessons and implementing mitigation measures to ensure we reduce the risk of this happening again in the future. The tool used in this case has already been re-examined and measures are underway to prevent this incident happening again.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
