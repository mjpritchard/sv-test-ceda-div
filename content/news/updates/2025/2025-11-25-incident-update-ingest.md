Dear users,

We have another update regarding the CEDA Archive data incident that occurred on 18th November 2025. Please read the key points below:

- New data is now starting to be deposited into the Archive.
- We have restored the Archive’s ‘skeleton’ directory structure. This means ~70% of the archive is now available again.
- For data recovery, we are going to prioritise popular datasets and data that is more integral to the structure of the Archive in the first instance.
- We have compiled a list of common questions - {{< link "/2025-11-24-incident-update.md" >}} please take a look at this. {{< /link >}}

Please bear with us during this time; it will be a lengthy and complex process, and we anticipate further obstacles down the road.

We appreciate your patience and understanding.

The CEDA Team
