{{< alert color="info" >}} We would like to encourage the community to complete the following survey about the use of Sentinel satellite data. {{< /alert >}}

Do you use Copernicus Sentinel satellite data? Copernicus services or other products/services incorporating Copernicus data or models? If so - please contribute to Know.Space’s independent evaluation of the UK’s participation in Copernicus on behalf of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and UK Space Agency.

**Please share your experience and usage in their short survey (<15 mins) before 9th December.**
To receive the full survey, email: **copernicus@know.space** or fill out this form with your contact details: **https://lnkd.in/eZippDNK**

Your input is critical, and will help DSIT understand the real impacts and benefits of the UK’s participation in Copernicus.

Thank you,
The CEDA Team
