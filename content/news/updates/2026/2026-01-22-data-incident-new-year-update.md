Dear users,
We have an update to share with you regarding our progress on the Archive data incident that occurred on the 18th November 2025.

We have made good progress recovering the data over the past month, with us continuing to retrieve data throughout the holiday period.

Around 1PB of MODIS data is being restored from source. This has only just started and will take some months to complete. We are using this as an opportunity to verify that we have the most useful data for our community and we will adjust our data holding in the light of feedback.  

We already keep the majority of our Sentinel data on tape only. We will be selectively restoring data as needed.

In December, {{< link "../2025/2025-12-19-data-incident-christmas-update.md" >}} we also successfully restored over 790TB of CMIP6 data in 27 hours using the online data transfer service Globus. {{< /link >}} That’s a rate of over 8GB per second! There are still some issues with some of the CMIP data but it is largely restored.

More than 90% of the data are back online, excluding MODIS and Sentinel. There are still issues to be resolved but we are working through these systematically.

We are aware that there has been an issue with access permissions on some of the recovered files, and we are currently working to resolve this. If you are having issues with accessing any of the recovered files, please email us at support@ceda.ac.uk

{{< link "../2025/2025-11-28-incident-data-list.md" >}} **A reminder that you can find the list of files affected here.** {{< /link >}}

Our plan going forward is to continue to recover the files as quickly as we are able, focusing on the higher-priority datasets that will be beneficial to the largest number of users upon recovery.

Thank you for your patience and understanding during this time, we apologise for any inconvenience.
The CEDA and JASMIN Team
